Module 9: Lab 9.2  

# Project Description
In this project we built a very simple javascript browser based game, using a windows event listener to track user keyboard input as "controls" for an evil circle. This is an extension of the bouncy ball demo that demonstrates object oriented programming in javascript.

## Running the Website

1. To run everything you will need to Fork or Clone this repository and open in up in an IDE on your local PC or in VS Codespaces.

2. Once you have cloned the Repo, open it up in VS Code.

3. Select the index.html file from the Explorer Window.

4. Then, using the VS Code Command Palette, type: > Live Preview Start Server. If this command is not available, you may need to install the VS Code Live Preview extension.

5. This will open up a website preview within your IDE. You can also open this in an external browser if you choose, by clicking on the 3 horizontal lines icon to the top right of the preview window and selecting 'Open in Browser'.

6. Play EvilCircle! To play evil circle, use the WSAD keys on your keybaord to move in the respective directions "W" = Up, S = Down, A = Left,  D = Right.

7. Keep track of the Ball Count at the top right of your screen for your score. When the evil Circle eats all the balls you win!

8. Note the evil circle (Mr. Stay Puft Marshmallow man) will grow with each ball you eat, however it's speed will also decrease to create a different challenge!

## Reflection
This was a good review of javascript fundamentals, and an advanced dive into object oriented programming in javascript (Which I've touched on slightly in personal endeavors).
This lab was really fun, and I added a few things (like an image instead of the evil circle) but started this a bit late and didn't finish all the things I wanted. However I do plan to play around a bit more and see just where I could possibly take this (and/or other ideas). This was a great creative ground to learn new things and I really enjoyed this lab!
